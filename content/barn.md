Castle Farm hosted two Brown daughter Weddings
in the space of 6 months. The first held in the depths of winter in a
PapaKata marquee. The second a mid-summer wedding held in the stone
barn. The family had such an enjoyable time and were delighted with the
response from the guests that attended. It made sense to put Rebeccaâ€™s
background of co-ordinating events to good use, and welcome others to
the farm.

## The Facilities

The space comprises of the beautiful stone barn, perfect for a sit down
banquet or buffet. The space also allows for evening entertainment and
suitable room to party.

The brick Roundhouse is the ideal space for reception drinks and is the
best place to home a bar. Later on the Roundhouse can also be used as a
break out or quiet area.

space for catering requirements is also provided.

The farm also has plenty of parking and outdoor space with a seasonal
changing backdrop ideal for photographs.
