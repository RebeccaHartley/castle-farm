# Big Barn Bash

![Alt text]({{/images/email/barn/venue_with_bunting_sepia.JPG  | prepend: site.baseurl}} "Optional title")

Castle Farm is the perfect setting for your wedding, event or special occasion.

As well as being a working farm with beautiful rolling countryside and a peaceful, tranquil setting as 

your backdrop. Castle Farm offers you an ideal location to guarantee a perfect day (not including the 

weather!) that will be individual, that little bit different, and be remembered for years to come. 

## Where it all began…propp

Castle Farm hosted two Brown daughter Weddings in the space of 6 months. The first held in the 

depths of winter in a PapaKata marquee. The second a mid-summer wedding held in 

the stone barn. The family had such an enjoyable time and were delighted with the 

response from the guests that attended. It made sense to put Rebecca’s 

background of co-ordinating events to good use, and welcome others to the farm.

## The Facilities

The space comprises of the beautiful stone barn, perfect for a sit down banquet or buffet. The space 

also allows for evening entertainment and suitable room to party.

The brick Roundhouse is the ideal space for reception drinks and is the best place to home a bar. 

Later on the Roundhouse can also be used as a break out or quiet area.

Luxury toilet facilities (with disabled access) are located onsite with an original farmhouse stone sink. 

Meaning no further loo hiring is required.
