Castle Farm is the perfect setting for your wedding, event or special
occasion. A working farm, beautiful rolling countryside and a
peaceful, tranquil backdrop for your big day. 
Castle Farm offers you an ideal location to guarantee a perfect day that will be individual, that little bit different, and be remembered for years to come.

## Where it all began...

Castle Farm hosted two Brown daughter Weddings
in the space of 6 months. The first held in the depths of winter in a
PapaKata marquee, the second a mid-summer wedding held in the stone
barn. The family had such an enjoyable time at both occasions and were delighted with the
response from the guests that attended. Rebecca has a background of co-ordinating events and many of the family have experience in hospitality, and so it made sense to put these skills to good use, and welcome others to the farm to share the surroundings.

## The Facilities

The facilities include the beautiful stone barn, perfect for a sit down
banquet or buffet. This area also allows for evening entertainment and
suitable room to party.

The brick Roundhouse is the ideal place for reception drinks and to home the bar. Later on the Roundhouse can also be used as a break out or quiet area.

Luxury toilet facilities (with disabled access) are located onsite with
an original farmhouse stone sink, meaning loo hiring is not
required.

A small kitchenette area for caterers, with the provision of additional
space for catering requirements is also provided.

The farm also has plenty of parking and outdoor space with a seasonal
changing backdrop ideal for photographs.

Castle Farm provides a space that is a rustic blank canvas, showing signs of it's former agricultural use, adding character and charm. It offers a
venue that will be unique, with perfect scope for personalising and
tailoring to suit all tastes.

We understand that everyone is individual and event
requirements are very personal, and we will work with you to create the
perfect day.
