Castle Farm is the perfect setting for your wedding, event or special
occasion. Whilst being a working farm, we provide beautiful rolling countryside and a
peaceful, tranquil backdrop for your big day. 
Playing host to only a handful of Weddings each year, the farm offers you a secluded and exclusive location to host your celebrations. You will be able to customise the aesthetic to create a bespoke gathering that will be a break from the norm and remembered for years to come.

## Where it all began...

Castle Farm hosted the Weddings of two Brown daughters in the space of 6 months. The first was held in the depths of winter in a PapaKata marquee. The second, a mid-summer wedding held in the stone barn. The family had such an enjoyable time on both occasions and were delighted with the
response from the guests that attended. Rebecca has a background of co-ordinating events and many of the family have experience in hospitality. With this in mind, and the fantastic feedback received, it made sense to put these skills to good use and to welcome others to the farm to share and enjoy the surroundings.

## The Facilities

The facilities include the beautiful stone barn. This area can be used to host a sit down banquet or buffet. The stone barn also allows for evening entertainment, ample room to party, and of course dancing.

The brick Roundhouse is the ideal place for reception drinks and to home the bar. Later on, the Roundhouse is a perfect break out space and quiet area.

Luxury toilet facilities (with disabled access) are located on-site with
an original farmhouse stone sink. Therefore, no extra cost for loo hire.

A small kitchenette area for caterers, with additional
space for catering requirements is also provided.

The farm has plenty of parking and outdoor space. Our location and rural setting also offer a seasonal and ever-changing backdrop for photographs.

Castle Farm provides a space that is a rustic blank canvas. The barn maintains it's agricultural roots adding character and charm. It offers a venue that is unique, with perfect scope for personalising and tailoring to suit all tastes.

We understand that everyone is individual and event
requirements are very personal, and we will work with you to create the
idyllic day.
