## Where it all began...

Castle Farm hosted two Brown daughter Weddings
in the space of 6 months. The first held in the depths of winter in a
PapaKata marquee. The second a mid-summer wedding held in the stone
barn. The family had such an enjoyable time at both occasions and were delighted with the
response from the guests that attended. Rebecca has a background of co-ordinating events and many of the family have experience in hospitality, and so it made sense to put this to good use, and welcome others to the farm.

## The Facilities

The space comprises of the beautiful stone barn, perfect for a sit down
banquet or buffet. This area also allows for evening entertainment and
suitable room to party.

The brick Roundhouse is the ideal place for reception drinks and to home the bar. Later on the Roundhouse can also be used as a break out or quiet area.

Luxury toilet facilities (with disabled access) are located onsite with
an original farmhouse stone sink, meaning loo hiring is not

A small kitchenette area for caterers, with the provision of additional
space for catering requirements is also provided.

The farm also has plenty of parking and outdoor space with a seasonal
changing backdrop ideal for photographs.
